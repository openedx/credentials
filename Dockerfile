# System requirements
# - git; Used to pull in particular requirements from github rather than pypi,
# and to check the sha of the code checkout.
# - language-pack-en locales; ubuntu locale support so that system utilities have a consistent
# language and time zone.
# - python; ubuntu doesnt ship with python, so this is the python we will use to run the application
# - python3-pip; install pip to install application requirements.txt files
# - libssl-dev; # mysqlclient wont install without this.
# - libmysqlclient-dev; to install header files needed to use native C implementation for
# MySQL-python for performance gains.
# - wget; to download a watchman binary archive
# - unzip; to unzip a watchman binary archive
# - pkg-config; mysqlclient>=2.2.0 requires pkg-config (https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient/issues/620)
