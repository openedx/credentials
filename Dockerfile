# Warning: This file is experimental.
#
# Short-term goals:
# * Be a suitable replacement for the `edxops/credentials` image in devstack (in progress).
# * Take advantage of Docker caching layers: aim to put commands in order of
#   increasing cache-busting frequency.
# * Related to ^, use no Ansible or Paver.
# Long-term goal:
# * Be a suitable base for production Credentials images. This may not yet be the case.

# Packages installed:
# git; Used to pull in particular requirements from github rather than pypi,
# and to check the sha of the code checkout.

# language-pack-en locales; ubuntu locale support so that system utilities have a consistent
# language and time zone.

# python; ubuntu doesnt ship with python, so this is the python we will use to run the application

# python3-pip; install pip to install application requirements.txt files

# libssl-dev; # mysqlclient wont install without this.

# libmysqlclient-dev; to install header files needed to use native C implementation for
# MySQL-python for performance gains.

# wget to download a watchman binary archive

# unzip to unzip a watchman binary archive
