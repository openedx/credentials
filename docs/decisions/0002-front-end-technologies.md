# Front End Technologies

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We would like to be consistent with technologies used on the front end.

## Decision

As Open edX [recommends][1], we'll use:
* React
* Webpack
* Sass
* npm

## Consequences

We need tooling that can support React's jsx files. Thankfully, standardizing
on these technologies with other Open edX components means we can share that
support.
