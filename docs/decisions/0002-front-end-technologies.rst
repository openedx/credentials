Front End Technologies
======================

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

We would like to be consistent with technologies used on the front end.

Decision
--------

As Open edX
`recommends <http://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0011-bp-FED-technology.html>`__,
we’ll use: \* React \* Webpack \* Sass \* npm

Consequences
------------

We need tooling that can support React’s jsx files. Thankfully,
standardizing on these technologies with other Open edX components means
we can share that support.
