Testing
=======

Writing Python Tests
--------------------
Tests should be written for all new features. The `Django docs`_ are a good resource for learning how to test Django code.

.. _Django docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/


Writing JS tests
----------------
All new front-end features should be made with React, subsequently, all tests written for those features should use the Jest testing framework.


Autoformatting
--------------
All code must be autoformatted or it will fail quality checks. All you need to do to autoformat your PR is run `make format`.
