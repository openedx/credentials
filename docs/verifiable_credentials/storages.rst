Learner Credential Wallet
-------------------------

`Official web-site`_:

    Learner Credential Wallet is an open source mobile wallet developed by the Digital Credentials Consortium, a network of leading international universities designing an open infrastructure for academic credentials.

Learner Credential Wallet (LCWallet) is a mobile app available for Android and IOS devices.

Usage prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LCWallet maintainer (`Digital Credentials Consortium`_) requires verifiable credentials issuer to be allow-listed (included to the trusted issuers list - `community issuer registry`_).

.. note::

    For development/testing purposes a `Sandbox Registry`_ is available. If you would like to be added to the Sandbox Registry, please open a pull requests directly against that repository, matching the format for existing issuers in `registry.json`

Learner experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This explains a generic usage flow for learners.

#. Learners have to download and install the official application (Google Play or App Store, we'll use Android version for examples).

#. Once installed there is initial one-time setup guide.

#. Learners navigate Learner Record MFE interface (`Verifiable Credentials tab`_) and claim for a verifiable credential issuance (clicking a :guilabel:`Create` button).

#. On the next step learners are asked for QR code scanning - that's where the LCWallet app starts its flow. Learners use :guilabel:`Scan QR code` option in the mobile application.

#. LCWallet processes QR code, communicates with the Open edX Platform and gets new verifiable credential. If everything is correct, now digital wallet holds the verifiable credential for the given Open edX credential (program certificate).
