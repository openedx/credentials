Badges
======

    The Badges feature allows learners to earn achievements (badges) for their learning activities.

- **Badge Template** is another kind of **credential**.
- **Badge** is another kind of **user credential**.


Current Badges version is highly integrated with the `Credly (by Pearson)`_ service, but it is fully prepared to be used separately.

Note: this feature shadows previously deprecated Badges (Badgr-based).
