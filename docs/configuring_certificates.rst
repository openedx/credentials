Configuring Certificates
========================


Enabling Hours of Effort
------------------------
To display the hours of effort for a program on the program certificate, follow these steps.

.. note:: To show Hours of Effort, the Total hours of effort field must have a value for a program set in the Discovery Django Admin at **Home** › **Course Metadata** › **Programs**. If this field has no value, Hours of Effort will not be displayed on the certificate.

#. Log in to the Credentials Django administration (``{credentials_base_url}/admin``).

#. On the **Site Administration** page, locate **Credentials** and select **Program certificate configurations**.

#. Create or update the Program certificate configuration you would like to enable Hours of Effort for.

#. Select the **Include hours of effort** checkbox.

#. Select **Save**. Program certificates generated after this change will include Hours of Effort.
