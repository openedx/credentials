edX Credentials Service |Codecov|_
====================================

.. |Codecov| image:: http://codecov.io/github/edx/credentials/coverage.svg?branch=master
.. _Codecov: http://codecov.io/github/edx/credentials?branch=master

This repository contains the edX Credentials Service, which supports course and program certificates. This service is a
replacement for the ``certificates`` app in ``edx-platform``.

Credentials can be run as part of devstack_ or Tutor_ (using the tutor_credentials_ plugin).

Where to run `make` commands
--------------------------

Due to the nature of developing in containers, some commands must be ran inside the container. Currently most commands
can be ran either inside the container or inside a local virtual environement, once developer requirements have been
installed (using the `make requirements` target).

Frontend Development
--------------------

The `Learner Record`_ feature and frontend components have been extracted into a dedicated MFE.

When developing frontend code in Credentials, some of the code must be transpiled and bundled for it to be usable. The
SASS code found in the ``credentials/static/sass`` directory of this project.

In order to view your changes, you must run one of the `make static` commands. `make static` builds and collects your
static assets once, while `make static.watch` will continue to watch for changes in your code and rebuild/recollect
whenever you save. When using `make static.watch` it only triggers after save, so if you have existing changes, you
need to run `make static` once first, or make a small change to an existing file and save it so it triggers a rebuild.

To see changes locally, from your devstack repo run ::

  make credentials-shell
  make static
  make static.watch

.. _Learner Record: https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learner-record

Testing
-------

In order for developers to have a consistent experience between CI and local testing, we are using a locally built
container image that mimics the ones that Github Actions uses.

NOTE: The first time you run any of the test suites below, it will build the image which will take a few minutes.
Following test runs will be quicker.

To run python and javascript tests locally ("unit_tests" in CI) ::

  make unit_tests_suite

To run quality and translation tests locally ("quality_and_translations_tests" in CI) ::

  make quality_and_translations_tests_suite

isort and formatting (`black`) quality issues can be fixed automatically by running either ::

  make isort
  # or
  make format
