This repository contains the edX Credentials Service, used as the backend to support Courses/Programs certificates.


Overview
--------

Credentials is edX's replacement for the ``certificates`` in ``edx-platform``. This extensible credentials system will
allow the learners to get certificates for Programs (XSeries) along with the existing ``certificates`` functionality.

A more detailed architecture overview is included `here <http://open-edx-credentials-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_.
