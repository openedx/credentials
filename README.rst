This repository contains the edX Credentials Service, used as the backend to support Courses/Programs certificates.


Overview
------------------------

Credentials is edX's replacement for the ``certificates`` in ``edx-platform``. This extensible credentials system will allow the learners to get certificates for Programs (XSeries) along with the existing ``certificates`` functionality.

A more detailed architecture overview is included `here <overview.rst>`_.
