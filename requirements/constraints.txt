# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why. Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# This upgrade causes a failure in tests currently. We need to constrain it until we
# can determine the cause of the failure. https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/MICROBA-794
virtualenv<20.2.2

# This is pinned due to a constrain in a third party dependency drf-jwt. We wonâ€™t be able to unpin social-auth until this dependency gets on pyJWT 2.0.0
# https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/MICROBA-929
social-auth-core<4.0.3

# Newer versions require passing in lms_user_id rather than a username.
# Ticket for adding LMS user IDs to Credentials: https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/MICROBA-649
edx-ace<1.0.0

# This has been pinned after a major version release to 1.x caused many tests to fail. At this time, there isn't much
# info available on how to fix forward. We will come back around to evaluate as part of MICROBA-1237.
