    Custom extension to DjangoModelPermissions for use with the
    UserCredentialViewSet.

    This permissions class uses an explicit 'view' permission, enabling support
    for:
        - explicitly granting certain users read access to any UserCredential
        - implicitly granting any user read access to UserCredentials that were
          awarded specifically to them
        - denying read access (obscured by HTTP 404) in any other case

    NOTE: users are allowed to read their own UserCredential records regardless
        of their 'status' (i.e. even if revoked).

    WARNING: this permissions implementation does not cover the 'list' method
        of access.  The access control required under DRF for that use case is
        presently implemented in the `list` method of the viewset itself.
